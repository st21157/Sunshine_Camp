# Sunshine_Adventure_Camp

Sunshine Adventure Camp is a facility that looks after 11 to 15 year olds during the winter and is only for the toughest kids. Groups go bush with a leader and fend for themselves. Each night the group leader radios in with their name, where they are, 
the number of campers and the current weather conditions. Each morning the camp leader radios in again to say if they are planning to stay or move on. Groups are always between 5 and 10 campers. 

You need to write a program that stores the required details. It also needs the ability to delete the details if the camp is moving on, or kept if not moving on. Your program must use an updateable list and a GUI. 

Write the program. Make sure you include good comments and use constants
